00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, Chris Sauer. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kate.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Chris, please, tell me a little bit about yourself.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, I'm currently finishing my Masters of Education program at Lake Erie College

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and working on transitioning from a northeastern Ohio inner

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to being a member of the Jacksonville area community.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Why the move?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She's very noble and admirable about you at the same time.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How did you hear about the position open with our company here at REI?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, when I thought about the opportunity of changing locations

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and moving from one physical location to another,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I thought about making a career move as well.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I was starting with my main interests and passions.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I love being outside, I love doing outdoor activities,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I love working with people.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I thought if I could use my experience as a teacher, helping people,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and my interest in the outdoors together,

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that would be a good place to start a new career.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And when I was looking online, I found REI's website

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area,

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
so I thought I would apply.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor activities,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
so this would be a great company for you to work at.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That being said, what else do you know about our company?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, I know you've been around for a long time since the late 1930s,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and what really caught my attention the most was the idea

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that it was started by people who had a passion for the outdoors

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and found a way to involve others in their experience.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I liked the idea, too, that your company is consistently ranked

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
among the top 100 companies to work for by Fortune Magazine.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
would be a good place to be.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Great.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why do you want this particular position here

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
within our customer service department?

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because I want to start in a position that allows me

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to learn everything about the company from the very basic level

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
of interacting with the customers all the way up

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
throughout the sales process, the marketing process,

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and the production of goods and services.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When I saw the opportunity for customer service,

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I thought it aligned very well with the skill set that I have

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and also with some skills that I could bring to the company

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
that might be unique.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Can you tell me a little bit more about these skills

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that you would transfer from your previous line of work

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
to our department here?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sure. In education, it's all about making the customer

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
or student feel comfortable and helping them grow.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I feel that within a company like REI,

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
it's the same philosophy, getting a customer comfortable

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
with the product and helping them grow as they advance

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in whatever sport they happen to be participating in.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why do you think that our company should hire you specifically

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
amongst our pool of candidates that are interviewing

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
for this position?

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sure. I think one skill set that I have

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
involves my background in education.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Teachers are among the highest stressed professionals

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
in the workplace, and REI offers a number of products

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
that help alleviate stress by getting people outdoors.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And teachers also have a lot of downtime in the summers.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My thinking is that once I learn the ropes

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and advance within the company, I'll be able to market

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the services and products that REI offers,

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
specifically to the teaching profession.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I have to ask this question.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Given that you are making a career change here,

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
especially with finishing a master's degree in education,

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
if a position becomes available in your current field

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
down here in the Jacksonville area,

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
how do you approach being offered this job

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
versus being offered a position in your field?

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I'm asking that in the now and in the future.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sure. That's a great question.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
within that profession.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I feel like this customer service opportunity,

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the chance to work in a field that I enjoy as much as teaching,

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is a place that I could grow into long term.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So what I get out of teaching is working with people

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and helping people become a little bit better

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
than they were when I first met them.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And that skill translates very well into REI's mission.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
for something I've already done.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Great.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Chris, what would you identify

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
as your greatest professional strengths?

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, I think patience is probably my greatest strength.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That translates across the careers,

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
being able to listen to a student or customer's difficulty

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and help them overcome that difficulty

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
with patience and compassion is my greatest strength.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Would you consider any weaknesses

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that you have to be detrimental to the job?

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think people can misinterpret compassion as being easy

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
or willing to roll over when it's important to understand

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that compassion is something that is earned and it's interactive.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I feel like if I establish clear boundaries

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
with customers, clients, students,

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
they understand that I am understanding.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I am patient. I am kind.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to a high standard.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Personally, becoming a teacher, earning a master's degree,

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
those have all been wonderful experiences for me.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But the greatest achievement would have to be

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
working with young people

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and helping them get a little bit better

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
at communicating with the world around them.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Chris, can you tell me about a challenge

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and how you would deal with it?

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sure.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Within the education profession, there are challenges every day.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and interests and levels of enthusiasm.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So being able to engage students with content

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
in an enriching way is part of overcoming a conflict or difficulty.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think building professional relationships

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
is another way to deal with conflicts,

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
understanding where people come from.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and very, very important events in people's lives.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And a lot of times conflicts would arise.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So again, just like in teaching,

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
overcoming those conflicts with patients

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and listening to the client or customers' needs

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is very important.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, you are interviewing for a position

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that is not an entry-level position

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and there is the possibility that those in our company

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
regarding the new hire for this position.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So how do you approach this potential challenge

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
here at the workplace?

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The important thing is to listen to the people around me

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and understand that I am a newcomer

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and that they know more about the work environment

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
than I will coming in.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think because I have a friendly demeanor

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and I'm not confrontational when meeting new people

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
that in time will have a chance to earn each other's mutual respect

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and understand that we both want the same thing,

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the company to grow and us to grow within the company.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where do you see yourself in five years,

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
specifically within our company?

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hopefully I'll be able to develop a market

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that allows me to interact with people within the teaching profession

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and grow our brand using that market as a target client base.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's great.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you interviewing currently with any other companies

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and if so, what interests you about those particular companies as well?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Since I'm new to the area,

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I haven't had the opportunity to interview with a wide variety of companies.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have looked at Bass Pro Shops

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They have a similar mission and similar goals to REI.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
than REI's more diverse offerings.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We here at REI, you know, it is, being in customer service,

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
there are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
than I could expect you being in a teaching position

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one face-to-face with individuals.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine, that's part of the job.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But what I would expect is to be actively engaged with the customers who come into the store

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and helping show them the products that might best suit their needs

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and introducing them to products that they might not have considered before.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So what I would expect is to be up moving around

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and being consistently engaged with a customer

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and how did you deal with this?

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and sometimes those initiatives get mandated.

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You have to teach this way this many times a week

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back to

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
what you know about your profession or your skill set

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I think when faced with a difficulty, again, it's important to do what the boss says

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and it's important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Alright, we're going to move on to some cognitive behavioral questions

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and basically these questions are designed...

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They're not necessarily about your past, your experience,

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
they're sort of out of the box questions

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and so just do your best at answering them as we go through this.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So if you were an animal, what would you be and why?

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's a tough question.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think considering the traits of my dog, if I had to be an animal

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They just have that ability to love unconditionally, they're intensely loyal

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and they just provide so many benefits to people.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's something I like to do in my life as a human too.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Great.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Tennis balls in a limousine.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, I guess to effectively answer that question I would need some help.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine.

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are we talking two-door, four-door?

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I also don't know what's in the limousine already.

212
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are there people in there or is it empty?

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Once I had those questions answered I would have to do some calculations

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up,

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
calculate the inside of the limousine and then make sure the math works out.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I could get that answer to you, I just can't do it off the top of my head.

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Great.

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let me ask this final question.

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you have any questions for us?

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, I mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm just curious, as a new employee or someone starting out on a lower level,

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
These aren't things that are necessarily scheduled regularly.

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
They're very semi-annual, they're very informal.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We do like to hear our employees' opinions about our products especially and about marketing.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
or the intake and distribution of customer service calls.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often,

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that, should you be hired for the position

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and maybe ways that we could do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company.

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And the last question for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for REI?

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming and even in my position

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
in somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me, we're very good to our employees.

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical in nature

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations.

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Great. Thank you so much for your time, Kate.

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Thank you so much.

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Take care.
