Hi, Chris all. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you Kate. Chris,

00:05.200 --> 00:08.400
please tell me a little bit about yourself. Well, I'm currently finishing my Master's

00:08.400 --> 00:13.360
of Education Program at Lake Erie College and working on transitioning from a Northeastern

00:13.360 --> 00:20.800
Ohio winner to being a member of the Jacksonville Area Community. Why the move?

00:20.800 --> 00:26.240
Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her. It's very

00:26.240 --> 00:32.240
noble and admirable about you at the same time. How did you hear about the position

00:32.240 --> 00:35.840
open with our company here at REI? Well, when I thought about the opportunity

00:35.840 --> 00:41.600
of changing locations and moving from one physical location to another, I thought about

00:41.600 --> 00:48.000
making a career move as well. And I was starting with my main interests and passions and I love

00:48.000 --> 00:54.080
being outside. I love doing outdoor activities and I love working with people. And I thought

00:54.080 --> 00:59.040
if I could use my experience as a teacher, helping people and my interest in the outdoors

00:59.040 --> 01:03.760
together, that would be a good place to start a new career. And when I was looking online,

01:03.760 --> 01:07.840
I found REI's website and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area,

01:07.840 --> 01:12.080
so I thought I would apply. Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor

01:13.440 --> 01:18.320
activities, so this would be a great company for you to work at that being said.

01:18.320 --> 01:22.320
What else do you know about our company? Well, I know you've been around for a long time since

01:22.320 --> 01:27.440
the late 1930s and what really caught my attention the most was the idea that it was started by

01:27.440 --> 01:33.920
people who had a passion for the outdoors and found a way to involve others in their experience.

01:34.560 --> 01:40.240
I like the idea too that your company is consistently ranked among the top 100 companies to

01:40.240 --> 01:45.680
work for by Fortune Magazine. And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success

01:45.680 --> 01:54.800
would be a good place to be. Why do you want this particular position here with within our customer

01:54.800 --> 02:00.800
service department? Because I want to start in a position that allows me to learn everything about

02:00.800 --> 02:05.200
the company from the very basic level of interacting with the customers all the way up throughout

02:05.200 --> 02:10.480
the sales process, the marketing process, and the production of goods and services.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.520
When I saw the opportunity for customer service, I thought it aligned very well with the skillset

02:15.520 --> 02:20.000
that I have and also with some skills that I could bring to the company that might be unique.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.520
Can you tell me a little bit more about the skills that you would transfer from your previous

02:23.520 --> 02:29.440
line of work to our department here? Sure, an education. It's all about making the customer or

02:29.440 --> 02:34.720
student feel comfortable and helping them grow. I feel that within a company like RAI, it's the

02:34.720 --> 02:40.720
same philosophy getting a customer comfortable with the product and helping them grow as they advance

02:40.720 --> 02:47.520
in whatever sport they happen to be participating in. Why do you think that our company should

02:47.520 --> 02:52.160
hire you specifically among the staff pool of candidates that are interviewing for this position?

02:52.160 --> 02:58.000
Sure, I think one skill set that I have involves my background education. Teachers are among

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
the highest-stressed professionals in the workplace and RAI offers a number of products that help

03:04.000 --> 03:09.120
alleviate stress by getting people outdoors and teachers also have a lot of downtime in the

03:09.120 --> 03:13.120
summers. My thinking is that once I learn the ropes and advanced it in the company, I'll be

03:13.120 --> 03:20.800
able to market the services and products that RAI offers specifically to the teaching profession.

03:23.360 --> 03:29.840
I have to ask this question. Given that you are making a career change here, especially with

03:29.840 --> 03:38.160
finishing a master's degree in education, if a position becomes available in your current field

03:38.160 --> 03:45.840
down here in the Jacksonville area, how do you approach being offered this job versus being offered

03:45.840 --> 03:51.680
a position in your field and I'm asking that in the now and in the future? Sure, that's a great

03:51.680 --> 03:57.840
question. I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities within that profession. I feel like

03:57.840 --> 04:03.840
this customer service opportunity, the chance to work and to feel that I enjoy as much as teaching,

04:03.840 --> 04:11.120
is a place that I could grow into, long-term. So what I get out of teaching is working with people

04:11.120 --> 04:15.680
and helping people become a little bit better than they were when I first met them and that skill

04:15.680 --> 04:23.200
translates very well into RAI's mission and so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career

04:23.200 --> 04:28.000
for something I've already done. I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.120
Chris, what would you identify as your greatest professional strengths?

04:39.440 --> 04:44.240
I think patience is probably my greatest strength. That translates across the careers

04:44.960 --> 04:50.560
being able to listen to a student or customers difficulty and help them overcome that difficulty

04:50.560 --> 04:56.560
with patience and compassion as my greatest strength. Would you consider any weaknesses that you

04:56.560 --> 05:03.520
have to be detrimental to the job? I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion. I think

05:03.520 --> 05:11.760
people can misinterpret compassion as being easy or willing to roll over when it's important to

05:11.760 --> 05:18.560
understand that compassion is something that is earn and it's interactive and I feel like if I

05:18.560 --> 05:24.000
establish clear boundaries with customer's client students they understand that I am understanding

05:24.000 --> 05:29.840
I am patient I am kind yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with to a high standard.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.680
To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?

05:37.840 --> 05:42.400
Personally becoming a teacher, earning a master's degree, those have all been wonderful

05:42.400 --> 05:48.400
experiences for me but the greatest achievement would have to be working with young people and

05:48.400 --> 05:52.080
helping them get a little bit better at communicating with the world around them.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.640
Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you faced in the workplace

06:01.200 --> 06:07.120
and how you would deal with it? Sure. Within the education profession there are challenges every day.

06:07.120 --> 06:13.600
You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities and interests and levels of enthusiasm

06:13.600 --> 06:20.240
so being able to engage students with content in an enriching way is part of overcoming a

06:20.240 --> 06:24.480
conflict or difficulty. I think building professional relationships is another way to deal with conflicts

06:24.480 --> 06:30.160
understanding where people come from. Prior to teaching I was involved with a photography company,

06:30.160 --> 06:35.280
photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs and very, very important events in

06:35.280 --> 06:39.280
people's lives and a lot of times conflicts would arise so again just like in teaching

06:39.280 --> 06:45.360
overcoming those conflicts with patients and listening to the client or customers needs is very

06:45.360 --> 06:52.320
important. Now you are interviewing for a position that is not an esery level position and

06:53.040 --> 06:57.760
there is the possibility that those in our company that we're overlooked for this position may

06:57.760 --> 07:03.360
have some animosity regarding the new hire for this position. So how do you approach

07:03.360 --> 07:08.480
this potential challenge here at the workplace? The important thing is to listen to the people

07:08.480 --> 07:13.760
around me and understand that I am a newcomer and that they know more about the work environment

07:13.760 --> 07:20.160
than I will coming in. I think because I have a friendly demeanor and I'm not confrontational

07:20.160 --> 07:24.240
when meeting new people that in time will have a chance to earn each other's mutual

07:24.240 --> 07:29.200
respect and understand that we both want the same thing. The company to grow and us to grow

07:29.200 --> 07:34.080
within the company. Where do you see yourself in five years specifically

07:34.080 --> 07:39.040
here within our company? Hopefully I'll be able to develop a market that allows me to interact

07:39.040 --> 07:44.480
with people within the teaching profession and grow our brand using that market as a target client

07:44.480 --> 07:54.240
base. It's great. Are you interviewing currently with any other companies and if so

07:54.240 --> 07:59.120
what interests you about those particular companies as well? Since some new to the area I haven't

07:59.120 --> 08:03.680
had the opportunity to interview with a wide variety of companies, I have looked at vast

08:03.680 --> 08:08.960
pro shops and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them. They have a similar mission and

08:08.960 --> 08:13.280
similar goals to RAI. It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored

08:14.000 --> 08:23.520
than RAI's more diverse offerings. We here at RAI, you know, it is being in customer service.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.160
There are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active than I could expect

08:28.160 --> 08:33.680
you being in a teaching position where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one

08:33.680 --> 08:41.280
base-to-face with individuals. Do you prefer a specific type of work environment? Do you thrive

08:41.280 --> 08:46.400
in a variety of work environments and what does this look like? I thrive in a variety of

08:46.400 --> 08:50.240
work environments. I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers

08:50.240 --> 08:54.080
unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine. That's part of the job. But what I would

08:54.080 --> 08:59.520
expect is to be actively engaged with the customers who come into the store and helping show

08:59.520 --> 09:03.200
them the products that might best suit their needs and introducing them to products that they

09:03.200 --> 09:09.440
might not have considered before. So I would expect to be moving around and being consistently

09:09.440 --> 09:14.320
engaged with a customer or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.

09:16.320 --> 09:22.160
Can you describe it time for me ever that you may have disagreed on a decision that was made

09:22.160 --> 09:27.120
for you and staff members at work and how did you deal with this? Sure. Within the field of

09:27.120 --> 09:31.280
education there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time and sometimes those initiatives

09:31.280 --> 09:36.240
get mandated. You have to teach this way this many times a week and when something like that

09:36.240 --> 09:42.000
happens I think it's important to go back to what you know about your profession or your skill set

09:42.000 --> 09:47.760
and you provide research that supports why you do what you do and I think when faced with a

09:47.760 --> 09:53.120
difficulty again it's important to do what the boss says and it's important to also advocate

09:53.120 --> 10:01.200
for what might be best for the customer or student. All right we're going to move on to some

10:02.080 --> 10:08.160
cognitive behavioral questions and basically these questions are designed. They're not necessarily

10:08.160 --> 10:15.120
about your past, your experience, they're sort of out of the box questions and so just do your

10:15.120 --> 10:20.720
best at answering them as you go through this. So if you were an animal what would you be and why?

10:22.560 --> 10:30.160
That's a tough question I think considering the traits of my dog if I had to be an animal

10:30.160 --> 10:36.240
I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog they just have that ability to love unconditionally

10:36.240 --> 10:42.000
their intensely loyal and they just provide so many benefits to people and that's something I'd

10:42.000 --> 10:49.680
like to do in my life as a human too. Great. The next question how many tennis balls can you

10:49.680 --> 10:58.000
fit into a limousine? Can this fall in the limousine? Well I guess to effectively answer that question

10:58.000 --> 11:03.200
I would need some help. I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about

11:03.200 --> 11:09.280
a stretch SUV that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine are we talking to door

11:09.280 --> 11:14.880
four door? I also don't know what's in the limousine already other people in there or is it empty?

11:16.080 --> 11:20.320
Once I had those questions answered I'd have to do some calculations about the size of a tennis

11:20.320 --> 11:25.920
ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up, calculate the inside of the limousine and then

11:25.920 --> 11:30.880
make sure the math works out. I could get that answer to you. I just can't do it off top of my head.

11:30.880 --> 11:39.760
Great. Let me ask this final question. Do you have any questions for us?

11:40.720 --> 11:45.760
Well I mentioned a couple of times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.

11:46.560 --> 11:52.000
I'm just curious as a new employee or someone starting out on the lower level how open is

11:52.000 --> 12:00.720
upper management hearing the ideas of an employee? We do try to have monthly meetings where we

12:00.720 --> 12:06.400
meet with a variety of employees around them. These aren't things that are necessarily scheduled

12:06.400 --> 12:15.600
regularly. They're very semi-annual. They're very informal. We do like to hear our employees

12:15.600 --> 12:21.520
opinions about our products especially and about marketing. One thing that we don't necessarily do

12:21.520 --> 12:30.400
is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections or the intake and

12:30.400 --> 12:36.080
distribution of customer service calls. We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very

12:36.080 --> 12:41.760
often but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that. Should you be hired for the

12:41.760 --> 12:47.280
position and maybe ways that we could do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees

12:47.280 --> 12:52.240
to benefit our company. Okay and then last question for me. What from your perspective is the best

12:52.240 --> 12:58.880
part about working for REI? I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming and

12:58.880 --> 13:04.880
even in my position in somewhat upper management those that I work for that are above me. They're

13:04.880 --> 13:11.760
very good to our employees and I think because of the treatment of our employees we retain

13:11.760 --> 13:17.760
employment. It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.600
I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical

13:23.600 --> 13:29.280
in nature and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do

13:29.280 --> 13:33.200
in those situations. So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in the

13:33.200 --> 13:37.200
our particular company is the atmosphere itself. Great. Thank you so much for your time. Okay.

13:37.200 --> 13:54.800
Thank you very much. Thank you.
