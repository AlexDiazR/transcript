00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hi, Chris all. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you Kate. Chris,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,400
please tell me a little bit about yourself. Well, I'm currently finishing my Master's

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
of Education Program at Lake Erie College and working on transitioning from a Northeastern

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,800
Ohio winner to being a member of the Jacksonville Area Community. Why the move?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,240
Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her. It's very

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,240
noble and admirable about you at the same time. How did you hear about the position

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,840
open with our company here at REI? Well, when I thought about the opportunity

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,600
of changing locations and moving from one physical location to another, I thought about

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,000
making a career move as well. And I was starting with my main interests and passions and I love

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,080
being outside. I love doing outdoor activities and I love working with people. And I thought

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,040
if I could use my experience as a teacher, helping people and my interest in the outdoors

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,760
together, that would be a good place to start a new career. And when I was looking online,

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
I found REI's website and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area,

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,080
so I thought I would apply. Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,320
activities, so this would be a great company for you to work at that being said.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,320
What else do you know about our company? Well, I know you've been around for a long time since

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,440
the late 1930s and what really caught my attention the most was the idea that it was started by

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,920
people who had a passion for the outdoors and found a way to involve others in their experience.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,240
I like the idea too that your company is consistently ranked among the top 100 companies to

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,680
work for by Fortune Magazine. And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:54,800
would be a good place to be. Why do you want this particular position here with within our customer

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,800
service department? Because I want to start in a position that allows me to learn everything about

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,200
the company from the very basic level of interacting with the customers all the way up throughout

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,480
the sales process, the marketing process, and the production of goods and services.

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,520
When I saw the opportunity for customer service, I thought it aligned very well with the skillset

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,000
that I have and also with some skills that I could bring to the company that might be unique.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Can you tell me a little bit more about the skills that you would transfer from your previous

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,440
line of work to our department here? Sure, an education. It's all about making the customer or

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,720
student feel comfortable and helping them grow. I feel that within a company like RAI, it's the

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,720
same philosophy getting a customer comfortable with the product and helping them grow as they advance

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,520
in whatever sport they happen to be participating in. Why do you think that our company should

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,160
hire you specifically among the staff pool of candidates that are interviewing for this position?

33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,000
Sure, I think one skill set that I have involves my background education. Teachers are among

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the highest-stressed professionals in the workplace and RAI offers a number of products that help

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,120
alleviate stress by getting people outdoors and teachers also have a lot of downtime in the

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
summers. My thinking is that once I learn the ropes and advanced it in the company, I'll be

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,800
able to market the services and products that RAI offers specifically to the teaching profession.

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,840
I have to ask this question. Given that you are making a career change here, especially with

39
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:38,160
finishing a master's degree in education, if a position becomes available in your current field

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,840
down here in the Jacksonville area, how do you approach being offered this job versus being offered

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,680
a position in your field and I'm asking that in the now and in the future? Sure, that's a great

42
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,840
question. I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities within that profession. I feel like

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,840
this customer service opportunity, the chance to work and to feel that I enjoy as much as teaching,

44
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,120
is a place that I could grow into, long-term. So what I get out of teaching is working with people

45
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
and helping people become a little bit better than they were when I first met them and that skill

46
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,200
translates very well into RAI's mission and so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,000
for something I've already done. I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,120
Chris, what would you identify as your greatest professional strengths?

49
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
I think patience is probably my greatest strength. That translates across the careers

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,560
being able to listen to a student or customers difficulty and help them overcome that difficulty

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,560
with patience and compassion as my greatest strength. Would you consider any weaknesses that you

52
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,520
have to be detrimental to the job? I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion. I think

53
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,760
people can misinterpret compassion as being easy or willing to roll over when it's important to

54
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,560
understand that compassion is something that is earn and it's interactive and I feel like if I

55
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,000
establish clear boundaries with customer's client students they understand that I am understanding

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,840
I am patient I am kind yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with to a high standard.

57
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,680
To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?

58
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,400
Personally becoming a teacher, earning a master's degree, those have all been wonderful

59
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,400
experiences for me but the greatest achievement would have to be working with young people and

60
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
helping them get a little bit better at communicating with the world around them.

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,640
Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you faced in the workplace

62
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,120
and how you would deal with it? Sure. Within the education profession there are challenges every day.

63
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,600
You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities and interests and levels of enthusiasm

64
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,240
so being able to engage students with content in an enriching way is part of overcoming a

65
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,480
conflict or difficulty. I think building professional relationships is another way to deal with conflicts

66
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,160
understanding where people come from. Prior to teaching I was involved with a photography company,

67
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,280
photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs and very, very important events in

68
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
people's lives and a lot of times conflicts would arise so again just like in teaching

69
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,360
overcoming those conflicts with patients and listening to the client or customers needs is very

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,320
important. Now you are interviewing for a position that is not an esery level position and

71
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,760
there is the possibility that those in our company that we're overlooked for this position may

72
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,360
have some animosity regarding the new hire for this position. So how do you approach

73
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,480
this potential challenge here at the workplace? The important thing is to listen to the people

74
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,760
around me and understand that I am a newcomer and that they know more about the work environment

75
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,160
than I will coming in. I think because I have a friendly demeanor and I'm not confrontational

76
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
when meeting new people that in time will have a chance to earn each other's mutual

77
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,200
respect and understand that we both want the same thing. The company to grow and us to grow

78
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,080
within the company. Where do you see yourself in five years specifically

79
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,040
here within our company? Hopefully I'll be able to develop a market that allows me to interact

80
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,480
with people within the teaching profession and grow our brand using that market as a target client

81
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:54,240
base. It's great. Are you interviewing currently with any other companies and if so

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
what interests you about those particular companies as well? Since some new to the area I haven't

83
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
had the opportunity to interview with a wide variety of companies, I have looked at vast

84
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,960
pro shops and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them. They have a similar mission and

85
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
similar goals to RAI. It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,520
than RAI's more diverse offerings. We here at RAI, you know, it is being in customer service.

87
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,160
There are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active than I could expect

88
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,680
you being in a teaching position where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one

89
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,280
base-to-face with individuals. Do you prefer a specific type of work environment? Do you thrive

90
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,400
in a variety of work environments and what does this look like? I thrive in a variety of

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,240
work environments. I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers

92
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,080
unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine. That's part of the job. But what I would

93
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,520
expect is to be actively engaged with the customers who come into the store and helping show

94
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,200
them the products that might best suit their needs and introducing them to products that they

95
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,440
might not have considered before. So I would expect to be moving around and being consistently

96
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,320
engaged with a customer or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.

97
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Can you describe it time for me ever that you may have disagreed on a decision that was made

98
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,120
for you and staff members at work and how did you deal with this? Sure. Within the field of

99
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,280
education there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time and sometimes those initiatives

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,240
get mandated. You have to teach this way this many times a week and when something like that

101
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,000
happens I think it's important to go back to what you know about your profession or your skill set

102
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,760
and you provide research that supports why you do what you do and I think when faced with a

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
difficulty again it's important to do what the boss says and it's important to also advocate

104
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:01,200
for what might be best for the customer or student. All right we're going to move on to some

105
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,160
cognitive behavioral questions and basically these questions are designed. They're not necessarily

106
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,120
about your past, your experience, they're sort of out of the box questions and so just do your

107
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,720
best at answering them as you go through this. So if you were an animal what would you be and why?

108
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,160
That's a tough question I think considering the traits of my dog if I had to be an animal

109
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,240
I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog they just have that ability to love unconditionally

110
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,000
their intensely loyal and they just provide so many benefits to people and that's something I'd

111
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,680
like to do in my life as a human too. Great. The next question how many tennis balls can you

112
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,000
fit into a limousine? Can this fall in the limousine? Well I guess to effectively answer that question

113
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,200
I would need some help. I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,280
a stretch SUV that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine are we talking to door

115
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,880
four door? I also don't know what's in the limousine already other people in there or is it empty?

116
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Once I had those questions answered I'd have to do some calculations about the size of a tennis

117
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,920
ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up, calculate the inside of the limousine and then

118
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,880
make sure the math works out. I could get that answer to you. I just can't do it off top of my head.

119
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:39,760
Great. Let me ask this final question. Do you have any questions for us?

120
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,760
Well I mentioned a couple of times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.

121
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm just curious as a new employee or someone starting out on the lower level how open is

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,720
upper management hearing the ideas of an employee? We do try to have monthly meetings where we

123
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,400
meet with a variety of employees around them. These aren't things that are necessarily scheduled

124
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:15,600
regularly. They're very semi-annual. They're very informal. We do like to hear our employees

125
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,520
opinions about our products especially and about marketing. One thing that we don't necessarily do

126
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:30,400
is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections or the intake and

127
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,080
distribution of customer service calls. We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very

128
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,760
often but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that. Should you be hired for the

129
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,280
position and maybe ways that we could do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees

130
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,240
to benefit our company. Okay and then last question for me. What from your perspective is the best

131
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,880
part about working for REI? I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming and

132
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,880
even in my position in somewhat upper management those that I work for that are above me. They're

133
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,760
very good to our employees and I think because of the treatment of our employees we retain

134
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,760
employment. It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.

135
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,600
I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical

136
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,280
in nature and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do

137
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,200
in those situations. So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in the

138
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
our particular company is the atmosphere itself. Great. Thank you so much for your time. Okay.

139
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:54,800
Thank you very much. Thank you.
