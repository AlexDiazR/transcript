0	4000	Hi, Chris Sauer. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kate.
4000	7000	Chris, please, tell me a little bit about yourself.
7000	10000	Well, I'm currently finishing my Masters of Education program at Lake Erie College
10000	14000	and working on transitioning from a northeastern Ohio inner
14000	19000	to being a member of the Jacksonville area community.
19000	21000	Why the move?
21000	26000	Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her.
26000	31000	She's very noble and admirable about you at the same time.
31000	34000	How did you hear about the position open with our company here at REI?
34000	38000	Well, when I thought about the opportunity of changing locations
38000	41000	and moving from one physical location to another,
41000	44000	I thought about making a career move as well.
44000	48000	And I was starting with my main interests and passions.
48000	52000	And I love being outside, I love doing outdoor activities,
52000	54000	and I love working with people.
54000	58000	I thought if I could use my experience as a teacher, helping people,
58000	60000	and my interest in the outdoors together,
60000	63000	that would be a good place to start a new career.
63000	66000	And when I was looking online, I found REI's website
66000	68000	and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area,
68000	70000	so I thought I would apply.
70000	74000	Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor activities,
74000	77000	so this would be a great company for you to work at.
77000	80000	That being said, what else do you know about our company?
80000	83000	Well, I know you've been around for a long time since the late 1930s,
83000	86000	and what really caught my attention the most was the idea
86000	90000	that it was started by people who had a passion for the outdoors
90000	94000	and found a way to involve others in their experience.
94000	98000	I liked the idea, too, that your company is consistently ranked
98000	102000	among the top 100 companies to work for by Fortune Magazine.
102000	105000	And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success
105000	107000	would be a good place to be.
107000	110000	Great.
110000	113000	Why do you want this particular position here
113000	116000	within our customer service department?
116000	119000	Because I want to start in a position that allows me
119000	123000	to learn everything about the company from the very basic level
123000	125000	of interacting with the customers all the way up
125000	127000	throughout the sales process, the marketing process,
127000	131000	and the production of goods and services.
131000	133000	When I saw the opportunity for customer service,
133000	136000	I thought it aligned very well with the skill set that I have
136000	139000	and also with some skills that I could bring to the company
139000	140000	that might be unique.
140000	142000	Can you tell me a little bit more about these skills
142000	144000	that you would transfer from your previous line of work
144000	146000	to our department here?
146000	149000	Sure. In education, it's all about making the customer
149000	152000	or student feel comfortable and helping them grow.
152000	154000	I feel that within a company like REI,
154000	158000	it's the same philosophy, getting a customer comfortable
158000	161000	with the product and helping them grow as they advance
161000	165000	in whatever sport they happen to be participating in.
165000	169000	Why do you think that our company should hire you specifically
169000	171000	amongst our pool of candidates that are interviewing
171000	173000	for this position?
173000	175000	Sure. I think one skill set that I have
175000	177000	involves my background in education.
177000	180000	Teachers are among the highest stressed professionals
180000	183000	in the workplace, and REI offers a number of products
183000	187000	that help alleviate stress by getting people outdoors.
187000	190000	And teachers also have a lot of downtime in the summers.
190000	192000	My thinking is that once I learn the ropes
192000	194000	and advance within the company, I'll be able to market
194000	197000	the services and products that REI offers,
197000	203000	specifically to the teaching profession.
203000	205000	I have to ask this question.
205000	208000	Given that you are making a career change here,
208000	214000	especially with finishing a master's degree in education,
214000	218000	if a position becomes available in your current field
218000	220000	down here in the Jacksonville area,
220000	224000	how do you approach being offered this job
224000	227000	versus being offered a position in your field?
227000	230000	And I'm asking that in the now and in the future.
230000	232000	Sure. That's a great question.
232000	235000	I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities
235000	237000	within that profession.
237000	240000	I feel like this customer service opportunity,
240000	244000	the chance to work in a field that I enjoy as much as teaching,
244000	247000	is a place that I could grow into long term.
247000	251000	So what I get out of teaching is working with people
251000	253000	and helping people become a little bit better
253000	255000	than they were when I first met them.
255000	259000	And that skill translates very well into REI's mission.
259000	263000	And so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career
263000	265000	for something I've already done.
265000	269000	I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.
269000	272000	Great.
272000	274000	Chris, what would you identify
274000	278000	as your greatest professional strengths?
278000	281000	Well, I think patience is probably my greatest strength.
281000	284000	That translates across the careers,
284000	288000	being able to listen to a student or customer's difficulty
288000	290000	and help them overcome that difficulty
290000	293000	with patience and compassion is my greatest strength.
293000	296000	Would you consider any weaknesses
296000	299000	that you have to be detrimental to the job?
299000	303000	I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion.
303000	307000	I think people can misinterpret compassion as being easy
307000	312000	or willing to roll over when it's important to understand
312000	317000	that compassion is something that is earned and it's interactive.
317000	320000	And I feel like if I establish clear boundaries
320000	322000	with customers, clients, students,
322000	324000	they understand that I am understanding.
324000	326000	I am patient. I am kind.
326000	329000	Yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with
329000	331000	to a high standard.
331000	337000	To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?
337000	341000	Personally, becoming a teacher, earning a master's degree,
341000	343000	those have all been wonderful experiences for me.
343000	346000	But the greatest achievement would have to be
346000	348000	working with young people
348000	350000	and helping them get a little bit better
350000	353000	at communicating with the world around them.
356000	358000	Chris, can you tell me about a challenge
358000	361000	or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace
361000	363000	and how you would deal with it?
363000	364000	Sure.
364000	367000	Within the education profession, there are challenges every day.
367000	371000	You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities
371000	374000	and interests and levels of enthusiasm.
374000	377000	So being able to engage students with content
377000	381000	in an enriching way is part of overcoming a conflict or difficulty.
381000	383000	I think building professional relationships
383000	385000	is another way to deal with conflicts,
385000	387000	understanding where people come from.
387000	390000	Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company
390000	393000	photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs
393000	396000	and very, very important events in people's lives.
396000	398000	And a lot of times conflicts would arise.
398000	400000	So again, just like in teaching,
400000	402000	overcoming those conflicts with patients
402000	405000	and listening to the client or customers' needs
405000	407000	is very important.
407000	409000	Now, you are interviewing for a position
409000	412000	that is not an entry-level position
412000	416000	and there is the possibility that those in our company
416000	419000	that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity
419000	422000	regarding the new hire for this position.
422000	425000	So how do you approach this potential challenge
425000	426000	here at the workplace?
426000	429000	The important thing is to listen to the people around me
429000	431000	and understand that I am a newcomer
431000	434000	and that they know more about the work environment
434000	436000	than I will coming in.
436000	439000	I think because I have a friendly demeanor
439000	441000	and I'm not confrontational when meeting new people
441000	445000	that in time will have a chance to earn each other's mutual respect
445000	447000	and understand that we both want the same thing,
447000	451000	the company to grow and us to grow within the company.
451000	453000	Where do you see yourself in five years,
453000	456000	specifically within our company?
456000	458000	Hopefully I'll be able to develop a market
458000	461000	that allows me to interact with people within the teaching profession
461000	465000	and grow our brand using that market as a target client base.
465000	467000	That's great.
471000	473000	Are you interviewing currently with any other companies
473000	477000	and if so, what interests you about those particular companies as well?
477000	479000	Since I'm new to the area,
479000	482000	I haven't had the opportunity to interview with a wide variety of companies.
482000	484000	I have looked at Bass Pro Shops
484000	486000	and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them.
486000	490000	They have a similar mission and similar goals to REI.
490000	493000	It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored
493000	496000	than REI's more diverse offerings.
496000	503000	We here at REI, you know, it is, being in customer service,
503000	507000	there are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active
507000	511000	than I could expect you being in a teaching position
511000	516000	where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one face-to-face with individuals.
516000	520000	Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?
520000	525000	Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?
525000	527000	Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.
527000	530000	I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers
530000	533000	unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine, that's part of the job.
533000	538000	But what I would expect is to be actively engaged with the customers who come into the store
538000	542000	and helping show them the products that might best suit their needs
542000	545000	and introducing them to products that they might not have considered before.
545000	548000	So what I would expect is to be up moving around
548000	551000	and being consistently engaged with a customer
551000	556000	or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.
556000	560000	Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed
560000	564000	on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work
564000	566000	and how did you deal with this?
566000	570000	Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time
570000	572000	and sometimes those initiatives get mandated.
572000	575000	You have to teach this way this many times a week
575000	579000	and when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back to
579000	582000	what you know about your profession or your skill set
582000	586000	and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do.
586000	591000	And I think when faced with a difficulty, again, it's important to do what the boss says
591000	599000	and it's important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.
599000	604000	Alright, we're going to move on to some cognitive behavioral questions
604000	607000	and basically these questions are designed...
607000	610000	They're not necessarily about your past, your experience,
610000	613000	they're sort of out of the box questions
613000	617000	and so just do your best at answering them as we go through this.
617000	622000	So if you were an animal, what would you be and why?
622000	624000	That's a tough question.
624000	630000	I think considering the traits of my dog, if I had to be an animal
630000	633000	I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog.
633000	638000	They just have that ability to love unconditionally, they're intensely loyal
638000	641000	and they just provide so many benefits to people.
641000	644000	That's something I like to do in my life as a human too.
644000	646000	Great.
646000	652000	The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?
652000	655000	Tennis balls in a limousine.
655000	659000	Well, I guess to effectively answer that question I would need some help.
659000	665000	I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV
665000	668000	that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine.
668000	670000	Are we talking two-door, four-door?
670000	673000	I also don't know what's in the limousine already.
673000	675000	Are there people in there or is it empty?
675000	679000	Once I had those questions answered I would have to do some calculations
679000	683000	about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up,
683000	687000	calculate the inside of the limousine and then make sure the math works out.
687000	691000	I could get that answer to you, I just can't do it off the top of my head.
691000	695000	Great.
695000	698000	Let me ask this final question.
698000	700000	Do you have any questions for us?
700000	706000	Well, I mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.
706000	711000	I'm just curious, as a new employee or someone starting out on a lower level,
711000	715000	how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?
715000	723000	We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random.
723000	727000	These aren't things that are necessarily scheduled regularly.
727000	732000	They're very semi-annual, they're very informal.
732000	739000	We do like to hear our employees' opinions about our products especially and about marketing.
739000	746000	One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections
746000	752000	or the intake and distribution of customer service calls.
752000	757000	We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often,
757000	762000	but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that, should you be hired for the position
762000	768000	and maybe ways that we could do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company.
768000	774000	And the last question for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for REI?
774000	781000	I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming and even in my position
781000	787000	in somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me, we're very good to our employees.
787000	793000	And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment.
793000	798000	It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.
798000	804000	I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical in nature
804000	810000	and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations.
810000	815000	So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself.
815000	817000	Great. Thank you so much for your time, Kate.
817000	818000	Thank you so much.
818000	823000	Take care.
