00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, Kristoff. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kate.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Krist, please tell me a little bit about yourself.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, I'm currently finishing my Masters of Education program at Lake Erie College

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and working on transitioning from a northeastern Ohioiner

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
to being a member of the Jacksonville area community.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Why, why the move?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's very noble and admirable about you at the same time.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How did you hear about the position open with our company here at REI?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, when I thought about the opportunity of changing locations

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and moving from one physical location to another,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I thought about making a career move as well.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I was starting with my main interests and passions.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And I love being outside. I love doing outdoor activities.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I love working with people. And I thought if I could use my experience as a teacher,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
helping people, and my interest in the outdoors together,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that would be a good place to start a new career.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And when I was looking online, I found REI's website

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I thought I would apply.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor activities.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So this would be a great company for you to work at.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That being said, what else do you know about our company?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, I know you have been around for a long time since the late 1930s.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And what really caught my attention the most was the idea

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that it was started by people who had a passion for the outdoors

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and found a way to involve others in their experience.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I like the idea too that your company is consistently ranked among the top

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
100 companies to work for by Fortune Magazine.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
would be a good place to be.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Great.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why do you want this particular position here

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
within our customer service department?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I want to start in a position that allows me to learn everything

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
about the company from the very basic level of interacting with the customers

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
all the way up throughout the sales process, the marketing process,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and the production of goods and services.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When I saw the opportunity for customer service,

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I thought it would align very well with the skillset that I have,

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and also with some skills that I could bring to the company that might be unique.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Can you tell me a little bit more about these skills that you would transfer

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
from your previous line of work to our department here?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sure.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In education, it's all about making the customer or student feel comfortable

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and helping them grow.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I feel that within a company like REI, it's the same philosophy,

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
getting a customer comfortable with the product and helping them grow

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
as they advance in whatever sport they happen to be participating in.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why do you think that our company should hire you specifically

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
amongst our pool of candidates that are interviewing for this position?

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sure.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I think one skill set that I have involves my background in education.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Teachers are among the highest-stressed professionals in the workplace,

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and REI offers a number of products that help alleviate stress

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
by getting people outdoors.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And teachers also have a lot of downtime in the summers.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My thinking is that once I learn the ropes and advance it from the company,

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll be able to market the services and products that REI offers

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
specifically to the teaching profession.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Great.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I have to ask this question.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Given that you are making a career change here,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
especially with finishing a master's degree in education,

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
if a position becomes available in your current field down here in the Jacksonville area,

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
how do you approach being offered this job versus being offered a position in your field?

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I'm asking that in the now and in the future.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sure. That's a great question.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities within that profession.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I feel like this customer service opportunity,

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the chance to work in a field that I enjoy as much as teaching

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
is a place that I could grow into long-term.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So what I get out of teaching is working with people

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and helping people become a little bit better than they were when I first met them.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And that skill translates very well into REI's mission.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
for something I've already done.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Chris, what would you identify as your greatest professional strengths?

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think patience is probably my greatest strength.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That translates across the careers being able to listen to a student

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
or customer's difficulty and help them overcome that difficulty

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
with patience and compassion is my greatest strength.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Would you consider any weaknesses that you have to be detrimental to the job?

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think people can misinterpret compassion as being easy

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
or willing to roll over when it's important to understand that compassion

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is something that is earned and it's interactive.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I feel like if I establish clear boundaries with customers, clients, students,

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
they understand that I am understanding, I am patient, I am kind.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with to a high standard.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Personally, becoming a teacher or earning a master's degree

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
those have all been wonderful experiences for me.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But the greatest achievement would have to be working with young people

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and helping them get a little bit better at communicating with the world around them.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and how you would deal with it?

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sure. Within the education profession, there are challenges every day.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities and interests and levels of enthusiasm.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So being able to engage students with content in an enriching way

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
is part of overcoming a conflict or difficulty.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I think building professional relationships is another way to deal with conflicts,

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
understanding where people come from.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company,

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs,

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and very, very important events in people's lives.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And a lot of times, conflicts would arise.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So again, just like in teaching, overcoming those conflicts with patients

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and listening to the client or customer's needs is very important.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Now, you are interviewing for a position that is not an entry-level position

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and there is the possibility that those in our company

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
regarding the new hire for this position.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So how do you approach this potential challenge here at the workplace?

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The important thing is to listen to the people around me

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and understand that I am a newcomer and that they know more

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
about the work environment than I will come in.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think because I have a friendly demeanor

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and I am not confrontational when meeting new people that in time

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
will have a chance to earn each other's mutual respect

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and understand that we both want the same thing.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The company to grow and us to grow within the company.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Where do you see yourself in five years specifically

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
within our company?

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hopefully I will be able to develop a market that allows me to interact

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
with people within the teaching profession and grow our brand

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
using that market as a target client base.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's great.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Are you interviewing currently with any other companies

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and if so, what interests you about those particular companies as well?

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Since I'm new to the area, I haven't had the opportunity to interview

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
with a wide variety of companies.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have looked at Bass Pro Shops and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They have a similar mission and similar goals to REI.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
than REI's whatever sufferings.

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We here at REI, you know, it is being in customer service.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
than I could expect you being in a teaching position

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
face-to-face with individuals.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine as part of the job.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But what I would expect is to be actively engaged with the customers

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
who come into the store and helping show them the products

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
that might best suit their needs and introducing them to products

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that they might not have considered before.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So what I would expect to be up moving around and being consistently engaged

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
with a customer or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and how did you deal with this?

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And sometimes those initiatives get mandated.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You have to teach this way this many times a week.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to what you know about your profession or your skill set

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I think when faced with the difficulty again, it's important to do what the boss says.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And it's an important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We're going to move on to some cognitive behavioral questions.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And basically these questions are designed.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They're not necessarily about your past, your experience.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They're sort of out of the box questions.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And so just do your best at answering them as soon as you go through this.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So if you were an animal, what would you be and why?

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's a tough question.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think considering the traits of my dog, if I had to be an animal,

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog.

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They just have that ability to love unconditionally.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They're intensely loyal.

178
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And they just provide so many benefits to people.

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And that's something I'd like to do in my life as a human too.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Great.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Tennis balls in a limousine.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, I guess to effectively answer that question, I would need some help.

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV,

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine.

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are we talking to door four door?

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I also don't know what's in the limousine already.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Are there people in there or is it empty?

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Once I had those questions answered, I would have to do some calculations

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up,

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
calculate the inside of the limousine, and then make sure the math works out.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I could get that answer to you.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I just can't do it off the top of my head.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Great.

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let me ask this final question.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you have any questions for us?

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, I've mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm just curious as a new employee or someone starting out on the lower level,

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So these aren't things that are necessarily scheduled regularly.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
They're very semi-annual, they're very informal.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We do like to hear our employees' opinions about our products especially and about marketing.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
or the intake and distribution of customer service calls.

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often,

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Should you be hired for the position and maybe ways that we could do better,

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company?

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay.

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the last question for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for REI?

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming.

213
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And even in my position in somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me,

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
they're very good to our employees.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.

217
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical in nature.

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself.

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Great. Thank you so much for your time, Kate.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Thank you so much.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you.
