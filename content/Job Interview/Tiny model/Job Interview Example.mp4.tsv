0	5200	Hi, Chris all. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you Kate. Chris,
5200	8400	please tell me a little bit about yourself. Well, I'm currently finishing my Master's
8400	13360	of Education Program at Lake Erie College and working on transitioning from a Northeastern
13360	20800	Ohio winner to being a member of the Jacksonville Area Community. Why the move?
20800	26240	Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her. It's very
26240	32240	noble and admirable about you at the same time. How did you hear about the position
32240	35840	open with our company here at REI? Well, when I thought about the opportunity
35840	41600	of changing locations and moving from one physical location to another, I thought about
41600	48000	making a career move as well. And I was starting with my main interests and passions and I love
48000	54080	being outside. I love doing outdoor activities and I love working with people. And I thought
54080	59040	if I could use my experience as a teacher, helping people and my interest in the outdoors
59040	63760	together, that would be a good place to start a new career. And when I was looking online,
63760	67840	I found REI's website and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area,
67840	72080	so I thought I would apply. Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor
73440	78320	activities, so this would be a great company for you to work at that being said.
78320	82320	What else do you know about our company? Well, I know you've been around for a long time since
82320	87440	the late 1930s and what really caught my attention the most was the idea that it was started by
87440	93920	people who had a passion for the outdoors and found a way to involve others in their experience.
94560	100240	I like the idea too that your company is consistently ranked among the top 100 companies to
100240	105680	work for by Fortune Magazine. And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success
105680	114800	would be a good place to be. Why do you want this particular position here with within our customer
114800	120800	service department? Because I want to start in a position that allows me to learn everything about
120800	125200	the company from the very basic level of interacting with the customers all the way up throughout
125200	130480	the sales process, the marketing process, and the production of goods and services.
130480	135520	When I saw the opportunity for customer service, I thought it aligned very well with the skillset
135520	140000	that I have and also with some skills that I could bring to the company that might be unique.
140000	143520	Can you tell me a little bit more about the skills that you would transfer from your previous
143520	149440	line of work to our department here? Sure, an education. It's all about making the customer or
149440	154720	student feel comfortable and helping them grow. I feel that within a company like RAI, it's the
154720	160720	same philosophy getting a customer comfortable with the product and helping them grow as they advance
160720	167520	in whatever sport they happen to be participating in. Why do you think that our company should
167520	172160	hire you specifically among the staff pool of candidates that are interviewing for this position?
172160	178000	Sure, I think one skill set that I have involves my background education. Teachers are among
178000	184000	the highest-stressed professionals in the workplace and RAI offers a number of products that help
184000	189120	alleviate stress by getting people outdoors and teachers also have a lot of downtime in the
189120	193120	summers. My thinking is that once I learn the ropes and advanced it in the company, I'll be
193120	200800	able to market the services and products that RAI offers specifically to the teaching profession.
203360	209840	I have to ask this question. Given that you are making a career change here, especially with
209840	218160	finishing a master's degree in education, if a position becomes available in your current field
218160	225840	down here in the Jacksonville area, how do you approach being offered this job versus being offered
225840	231680	a position in your field and I'm asking that in the now and in the future? Sure, that's a great
231680	237840	question. I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities within that profession. I feel like
237840	243840	this customer service opportunity, the chance to work and to feel that I enjoy as much as teaching,
243840	251120	is a place that I could grow into, long-term. So what I get out of teaching is working with people
251120	255680	and helping people become a little bit better than they were when I first met them and that skill
255680	263200	translates very well into RAI's mission and so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career
263200	268000	for something I've already done. I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.
272000	277120	Chris, what would you identify as your greatest professional strengths?
279440	284240	I think patience is probably my greatest strength. That translates across the careers
284960	290560	being able to listen to a student or customers difficulty and help them overcome that difficulty
290560	296560	with patience and compassion as my greatest strength. Would you consider any weaknesses that you
296560	303520	have to be detrimental to the job? I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion. I think
303520	311760	people can misinterpret compassion as being easy or willing to roll over when it's important to
311760	318560	understand that compassion is something that is earn and it's interactive and I feel like if I
318560	324000	establish clear boundaries with customer's client students they understand that I am understanding
324000	329840	I am patient I am kind yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with to a high standard.
331840	335680	To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?
337840	342400	Personally becoming a teacher, earning a master's degree, those have all been wonderful
342400	348400	experiences for me but the greatest achievement would have to be working with young people and
348400	352080	helping them get a little bit better at communicating with the world around them.
356480	360640	Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you faced in the workplace
361200	367120	and how you would deal with it? Sure. Within the education profession there are challenges every day.
367120	373600	You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities and interests and levels of enthusiasm
373600	380240	so being able to engage students with content in an enriching way is part of overcoming a
380240	384480	conflict or difficulty. I think building professional relationships is another way to deal with conflicts
384480	390160	understanding where people come from. Prior to teaching I was involved with a photography company,
390160	395280	photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs and very, very important events in
395280	399280	people's lives and a lot of times conflicts would arise so again just like in teaching
399280	405360	overcoming those conflicts with patients and listening to the client or customers needs is very
405360	412320	important. Now you are interviewing for a position that is not an esery level position and
413040	417760	there is the possibility that those in our company that we're overlooked for this position may
417760	423360	have some animosity regarding the new hire for this position. So how do you approach
423360	428480	this potential challenge here at the workplace? The important thing is to listen to the people
428480	433760	around me and understand that I am a newcomer and that they know more about the work environment
433760	440160	than I will coming in. I think because I have a friendly demeanor and I'm not confrontational
440160	444240	when meeting new people that in time will have a chance to earn each other's mutual
444240	449200	respect and understand that we both want the same thing. The company to grow and us to grow
449200	454080	within the company. Where do you see yourself in five years specifically
454080	459040	here within our company? Hopefully I'll be able to develop a market that allows me to interact
459040	464480	with people within the teaching profession and grow our brand using that market as a target client
464480	474240	base. It's great. Are you interviewing currently with any other companies and if so
474240	479120	what interests you about those particular companies as well? Since some new to the area I haven't
479120	483680	had the opportunity to interview with a wide variety of companies, I have looked at vast
483680	488960	pro shops and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them. They have a similar mission and
488960	493280	similar goals to RAI. It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored
494000	503520	than RAI's more diverse offerings. We here at RAI, you know, it is being in customer service.
503520	508160	There are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active than I could expect
508160	513680	you being in a teaching position where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one
513680	521280	base-to-face with individuals. Do you prefer a specific type of work environment? Do you thrive
521280	526400	in a variety of work environments and what does this look like? I thrive in a variety of
526400	530240	work environments. I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers
530240	534080	unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine. That's part of the job. But what I would
534080	539520	expect is to be actively engaged with the customers who come into the store and helping show
539520	543200	them the products that might best suit their needs and introducing them to products that they
543200	549440	might not have considered before. So I would expect to be moving around and being consistently
549440	554320	engaged with a customer or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.
556320	562160	Can you describe it time for me ever that you may have disagreed on a decision that was made
562160	567120	for you and staff members at work and how did you deal with this? Sure. Within the field of
567120	571280	education there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time and sometimes those initiatives
571280	576240	get mandated. You have to teach this way this many times a week and when something like that
576240	582000	happens I think it's important to go back to what you know about your profession or your skill set
582000	587760	and you provide research that supports why you do what you do and I think when faced with a
587760	593120	difficulty again it's important to do what the boss says and it's important to also advocate
593120	601200	for what might be best for the customer or student. All right we're going to move on to some
602080	608160	cognitive behavioral questions and basically these questions are designed. They're not necessarily
608160	615120	about your past, your experience, they're sort of out of the box questions and so just do your
615120	620720	best at answering them as you go through this. So if you were an animal what would you be and why?
622560	630160	That's a tough question I think considering the traits of my dog if I had to be an animal
630160	636240	I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog they just have that ability to love unconditionally
636240	642000	their intensely loyal and they just provide so many benefits to people and that's something I'd
642000	649680	like to do in my life as a human too. Great. The next question how many tennis balls can you
649680	658000	fit into a limousine? Can this fall in the limousine? Well I guess to effectively answer that question
658000	663200	I would need some help. I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about
663200	669280	a stretch SUV that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine are we talking to door
669280	674880	four door? I also don't know what's in the limousine already other people in there or is it empty?
676080	680320	Once I had those questions answered I'd have to do some calculations about the size of a tennis
680320	685920	ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up, calculate the inside of the limousine and then
685920	690880	make sure the math works out. I could get that answer to you. I just can't do it off top of my head.
690880	699760	Great. Let me ask this final question. Do you have any questions for us?
700720	705760	Well I mentioned a couple of times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.
706560	712000	I'm just curious as a new employee or someone starting out on the lower level how open is
712000	720720	upper management hearing the ideas of an employee? We do try to have monthly meetings where we
720720	726400	meet with a variety of employees around them. These aren't things that are necessarily scheduled
726400	735600	regularly. They're very semi-annual. They're very informal. We do like to hear our employees
735600	741520	opinions about our products especially and about marketing. One thing that we don't necessarily do
741520	750400	is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections or the intake and
750400	756080	distribution of customer service calls. We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very
756080	761760	often but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that. Should you be hired for the
761760	767280	position and maybe ways that we could do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees
767280	772240	to benefit our company. Okay and then last question for me. What from your perspective is the best
772240	778880	part about working for REI? I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming and
778880	784880	even in my position in somewhat upper management those that I work for that are above me. They're
784880	791760	very good to our employees and I think because of the treatment of our employees we retain
791760	797760	employment. It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.
799120	803600	I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical
803600	809280	in nature and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do
809280	813200	in those situations. So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in the
813200	817200	our particular company is the atmosphere itself. Great. Thank you so much for your time. Okay.
817200	834800	Thank you very much. Thank you.
