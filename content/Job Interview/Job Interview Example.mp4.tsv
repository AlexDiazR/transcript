0	4000	Hi, Kristoff. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kate.
4000	7000	Krist, please tell me a little bit about yourself.
7000	10000	Well, I'm currently finishing my Masters of Education program at Lake Erie College
10000	14000	and working on transitioning from a northeastern Ohioiner
14000	19000	to being a member of the Jacksonville area community.
19000	21000	Why, why the move?
21000	25000	Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her.
25000	30000	It's very noble and admirable about you at the same time.
30000	34000	How did you hear about the position open with our company here at REI?
34000	37000	Well, when I thought about the opportunity of changing locations
37000	40000	and moving from one physical location to another,
40000	43000	I thought about making a career move as well.
43000	47000	And I was starting with my main interests and passions.
47000	51000	And I love being outside. I love doing outdoor activities.
51000	56000	And I love working with people. And I thought if I could use my experience as a teacher,
56000	59000	helping people, and my interest in the outdoors together,
59000	62000	that would be a good place to start a new career.
62000	65000	And when I was looking online, I found REI's website
65000	68000	and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area.
68000	69000	So I thought I would apply.
69000	74000	Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor activities.
74000	77000	So this would be a great company for you to work at.
77000	80000	That being said, what else do you know about our company?
80000	83000	Well, I know you have been around for a long time since the late 1930s.
83000	86000	And what really caught my attention the most was the idea
86000	90000	that it was started by people who had a passion for the outdoors
90000	94000	and found a way to involve others in their experience.
94000	99000	I like the idea too that your company is consistently ranked among the top
99000	102000	100 companies to work for by Fortune Magazine.
102000	105000	And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success
105000	107000	would be a good place to be.
107000	110000	Great.
110000	113000	Why do you want this particular position here
113000	116000	within our customer service department?
116000	120000	Because I want to start in a position that allows me to learn everything
120000	124000	about the company from the very basic level of interacting with the customers
124000	127000	all the way up throughout the sales process, the marketing process,
127000	131000	and the production of goods and services.
131000	133000	When I saw the opportunity for customer service,
133000	137000	I thought it would align very well with the skillset that I have,
137000	140000	and also with some skills that I could bring to the company that might be unique.
140000	143000	Can you tell me a little bit more about these skills that you would transfer
143000	146000	from your previous line of work to our department here?
146000	147000	Sure.
147000	151000	In education, it's all about making the customer or student feel comfortable
151000	153000	and helping them grow.
153000	156000	I feel that within a company like REI, it's the same philosophy,
156000	160000	getting a customer comfortable with the product and helping them grow
160000	165000	as they advance in whatever sport they happen to be participating in.
165000	169000	Why do you think that our company should hire you specifically
169000	173000	amongst our pool of candidates that are interviewing for this position?
173000	174000	Sure.
174000	177000	I think one skill set that I have involves my background in education.
177000	181000	Teachers are among the highest-stressed professionals in the workplace,
181000	185000	and REI offers a number of products that help alleviate stress
185000	187000	by getting people outdoors.
187000	190000	And teachers also have a lot of downtime in the summers.
190000	193000	My thinking is that once I learn the ropes and advance it from the company,
193000	197000	I'll be able to market the services and products that REI offers
197000	201000	specifically to the teaching profession.
201000	203000	Great.
203000	205000	I have to ask this question.
205000	208000	Given that you are making a career change here,
208000	214000	especially with finishing a master's degree in education,
214000	220000	if a position becomes available in your current field down here in the Jacksonville area,
220000	227000	how do you approach being offered this job versus being offered a position in your field?
227000	231000	And I'm asking that in the now and in the future.
231000	232000	Sure. That's a great question.
232000	236000	I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities within that profession.
236000	239000	I feel like this customer service opportunity,
239000	243000	the chance to work in a field that I enjoy as much as teaching
243000	247000	is a place that I could grow into long-term.
247000	251000	So what I get out of teaching is working with people
251000	255000	and helping people become a little bit better than they were when I first met them.
255000	259000	And that skill translates very well into REI's mission.
259000	263000	And so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career
263000	265000	for something I've already done.
265000	269000	I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.
269000	271000	Okay.
271000	279000	Chris, what would you identify as your greatest professional strengths?
279000	281000	I think patience is probably my greatest strength.
281000	287000	That translates across the careers being able to listen to a student
287000	290000	or customer's difficulty and help them overcome that difficulty
290000	293000	with patience and compassion is my greatest strength.
293000	299000	Would you consider any weaknesses that you have to be detrimental to the job?
299000	303000	I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion.
303000	307000	I think people can misinterpret compassion as being easy
307000	313000	or willing to roll over when it's important to understand that compassion
313000	317000	is something that is earned and it's interactive.
317000	322000	And I feel like if I establish clear boundaries with customers, clients, students,
322000	325000	they understand that I am understanding, I am patient, I am kind.
325000	331000	Yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with to a high standard.
331000	337000	To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?
337000	341000	Personally, becoming a teacher or earning a master's degree
341000	343000	those have all been wonderful experiences for me.
343000	347000	But the greatest achievement would have to be working with young people
347000	353000	and helping them get a little bit better at communicating with the world around them.
353000	361000	Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace
361000	363000	and how you would deal with it?
363000	367000	Sure. Within the education profession, there are challenges every day.
367000	373000	You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities and interests and levels of enthusiasm.
373000	378000	So being able to engage students with content in an enriching way
378000	381000	is part of overcoming a conflict or difficulty.
381000	384000	I think building professional relationships is another way to deal with conflicts,
384000	386000	understanding where people come from.
386000	390000	Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company,
390000	393000	photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs,
393000	396000	and very, very important events in people's lives.
396000	398000	And a lot of times, conflicts would arise.
398000	402000	So again, just like in teaching, overcoming those conflicts with patients
402000	406000	and listening to the client or customer's needs is very important.
406000	412000	Now, you are interviewing for a position that is not an entry-level position
412000	416000	and there is the possibility that those in our company
416000	419000	that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity
419000	422000	regarding the new hire for this position.
422000	426000	So how do you approach this potential challenge here at the workplace?
426000	429000	The important thing is to listen to the people around me
429000	432000	and understand that I am a newcomer and that they know more
432000	436000	about the work environment than I will come in.
436000	438000	I think because I have a friendly demeanor
438000	442000	and I am not confrontational when meeting new people that in time
442000	445000	will have a chance to earn each other's mutual respect
445000	447000	and understand that we both want the same thing.
447000	451000	The company to grow and us to grow within the company.
451000	454000	Where do you see yourself in five years specifically
454000	456000	within our company?
456000	459000	Hopefully I will be able to develop a market that allows me to interact
459000	462000	with people within the teaching profession and grow our brand
462000	465000	using that market as a target client base.
465000	468000	That's great.
470000	473000	Are you interviewing currently with any other companies
473000	477000	and if so, what interests you about those particular companies as well?
477000	480000	Since I'm new to the area, I haven't had the opportunity to interview
480000	482000	with a wide variety of companies.
482000	486000	I have looked at Bass Pro Shops and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them.
486000	490000	They have a similar mission and similar goals to REI.
490000	493000	It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored
493000	498000	than REI's whatever sufferings.
498000	503000	We here at REI, you know, it is being in customer service.
503000	507000	There are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active
507000	510000	than I could expect you being in a teaching position
510000	513000	where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one
513000	516000	face-to-face with individuals.
516000	520000	Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?
520000	525000	Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?
525000	527000	Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.
527000	530000	I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers
530000	533000	unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine as part of the job.
533000	537000	But what I would expect is to be actively engaged with the customers
537000	540000	who come into the store and helping show them the products
540000	543000	that might best suit their needs and introducing them to products
543000	545000	that they might not have considered before.
545000	550000	So what I would expect to be up moving around and being consistently engaged
550000	556000	with a customer or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.
556000	560000	Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed
560000	564000	on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work
564000	566000	and how did you deal with this?
566000	570000	Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time.
570000	572000	And sometimes those initiatives get mandated.
572000	575000	You have to teach this way this many times a week.
575000	578000	And when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back
578000	582000	to what you know about your profession or your skill set
582000	586000	and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do.
586000	591000	And I think when faced with the difficulty again, it's important to do what the boss says.
591000	599000	And it's an important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.
599000	600000	All right.
600000	604000	We're going to move on to some cognitive behavioral questions.
604000	607000	And basically these questions are designed.
607000	610000	They're not necessarily about your past, your experience.
610000	613000	They're sort of out of the box questions.
613000	617000	And so just do your best at answering them as soon as you go through this.
617000	622000	So if you were an animal, what would you be and why?
622000	624000	That's a tough question.
624000	630000	I think considering the traits of my dog, if I had to be an animal,
630000	633000	I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog.
633000	636000	They just have that ability to love unconditionally.
636000	638000	They're intensely loyal.
638000	641000	And they just provide so many benefits to people.
641000	644000	And that's something I'd like to do in my life as a human too.
644000	645000	Great.
645000	652000	The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?
652000	655000	Tennis balls in a limousine.
655000	659000	Well, I guess to effectively answer that question, I would need some help.
659000	665000	I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV,
665000	668000	that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine.
668000	670000	Are we talking to door four door?
670000	673000	I also don't know what's in the limousine already.
673000	676000	Are there people in there or is it empty?
676000	679000	Once I had those questions answered, I would have to do some calculations
679000	684000	about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up,
684000	687000	calculate the inside of the limousine, and then make sure the math works out.
687000	689000	I could get that answer to you.
689000	691000	I just can't do it off the top of my head.
691000	695000	Great.
695000	698000	Let me ask this final question.
698000	700000	Do you have any questions for us?
700000	706000	Well, I've mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.
706000	711000	I'm just curious as a new employee or someone starting out on the lower level,
711000	716000	how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?
716000	723000	We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random.
723000	727000	So these aren't things that are necessarily scheduled regularly.
727000	732000	They're very semi-annual, they're very informal.
732000	739000	We do like to hear our employees' opinions about our products especially and about marketing.
739000	746000	One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections
746000	752000	or the intake and distribution of customer service calls.
752000	757000	We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often,
757000	761000	but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that.
761000	764000	Should you be hired for the position and maybe ways that we could do better,
764000	768000	as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company?
768000	769000	Okay.
769000	775000	And the last question for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for REI?
775000	779000	I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming.
779000	785000	And even in my position in somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me,
785000	788000	they're very good to our employees.
788000	793000	And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment.
793000	799000	It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.
799000	805000	I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical in nature.
805000	811000	It's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations.
811000	816000	So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself.
816000	818000	Great. Thank you so much for your time, Kate.
818000	819000	Thank you so much.
819000	836000	Thank you.
