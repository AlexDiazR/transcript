00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi, Kristoff. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kate.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Krist, please tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, I'm currently finishing my Masters of Education program at Lake Erie College

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
and working on transitioning from a northeastern Ohioiner

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
to being a member of the Jacksonville area community.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Why, why the move?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
It's very noble and admirable about you at the same time.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
How did you hear about the position open with our company here at REI?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Well, when I thought about the opportunity of changing locations

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
and moving from one physical location to another,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I thought about making a career move as well.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And I was starting with my main interests and passions.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
And I love being outside. I love doing outdoor activities.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
And I love working with people. And I thought if I could use my experience as a teacher,

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
helping people, and my interest in the outdoors together,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
that would be a good place to start a new career.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
And when I was looking online, I found REI's website

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
So I thought I would apply.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor activities.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
So this would be a great company for you to work at.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
That being said, what else do you know about our company?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, I know you have been around for a long time since the late 1930s.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And what really caught my attention the most was the idea

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
that it was started by people who had a passion for the outdoors

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
and found a way to involve others in their experience.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
I like the idea too that your company is consistently ranked among the top

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
100 companies to work for by Fortune Magazine.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
would be a good place to be.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Great.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Why do you want this particular position here

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
within our customer service department?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Because I want to start in a position that allows me to learn everything

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
about the company from the very basic level of interacting with the customers

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
all the way up throughout the sales process, the marketing process,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
and the production of goods and services.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
When I saw the opportunity for customer service,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I thought it would align very well with the skillset that I have,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
and also with some skills that I could bring to the company that might be unique.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Can you tell me a little bit more about these skills that you would transfer

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
from your previous line of work to our department here?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Sure.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
In education, it's all about making the customer or student feel comfortable

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
and helping them grow.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I feel that within a company like REI, it's the same philosophy,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
getting a customer comfortable with the product and helping them grow

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
as they advance in whatever sport they happen to be participating in.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Why do you think that our company should hire you specifically

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
amongst our pool of candidates that are interviewing for this position?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Sure.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I think one skill set that I have involves my background in education.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Teachers are among the highest-stressed professionals in the workplace,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
and REI offers a number of products that help alleviate stress

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
by getting people outdoors.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And teachers also have a lot of downtime in the summers.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
My thinking is that once I learn the ropes and advance it from the company,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I'll be able to market the services and products that REI offers

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
specifically to the teaching profession.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Great.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I have to ask this question.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Given that you are making a career change here,

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
especially with finishing a master's degree in education,

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
if a position becomes available in your current field down here in the Jacksonville area,

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
how do you approach being offered this job versus being offered a position in your field?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
And I'm asking that in the now and in the future.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Sure. That's a great question.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities within that profession.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I feel like this customer service opportunity,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
the chance to work in a field that I enjoy as much as teaching

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
is a place that I could grow into long-term.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
So what I get out of teaching is working with people

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
and helping people become a little bit better than they were when I first met them.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
And that skill translates very well into REI's mission.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
for something I've already done.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
Chris, what would you identify as your greatest professional strengths?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I think patience is probably my greatest strength.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
That translates across the careers being able to listen to a student

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
or customer's difficulty and help them overcome that difficulty

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
with patience and compassion is my greatest strength.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
Would you consider any weaknesses that you have to be detrimental to the job?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
I think people can misinterpret compassion as being easy

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
or willing to roll over when it's important to understand that compassion

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
is something that is earned and it's interactive.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
And I feel like if I establish clear boundaries with customers, clients, students,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
they understand that I am understanding, I am patient, I am kind.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
Yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with to a high standard.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Personally, becoming a teacher or earning a master's degree

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
those have all been wonderful experiences for me.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
But the greatest achievement would have to be working with young people

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
and helping them get a little bit better at communicating with the world around them.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
Chris, can you tell me about a challenge or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
and how you would deal with it?

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Sure. Within the education profession, there are challenges every day.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities and interests and levels of enthusiasm.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
So being able to engage students with content in an enriching way

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
is part of overcoming a conflict or difficulty.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I think building professional relationships is another way to deal with conflicts,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
understanding where people come from.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs,

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
and very, very important events in people's lives.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And a lot of times, conflicts would arise.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
So again, just like in teaching, overcoming those conflicts with patients

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
and listening to the client or customer's needs is very important.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Now, you are interviewing for a position that is not an entry-level position

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
and there is the possibility that those in our company

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
regarding the new hire for this position.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
So how do you approach this potential challenge here at the workplace?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
The important thing is to listen to the people around me

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
and understand that I am a newcomer and that they know more

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
about the work environment than I will come in.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I think because I have a friendly demeanor

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
and I am not confrontational when meeting new people that in time

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
will have a chance to earn each other's mutual respect

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
and understand that we both want the same thing.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
The company to grow and us to grow within the company.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Where do you see yourself in five years specifically

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
within our company?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Hopefully I will be able to develop a market that allows me to interact

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
with people within the teaching profession and grow our brand

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
using that market as a target client base.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
That's great.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Are you interviewing currently with any other companies

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
and if so, what interests you about those particular companies as well?

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Since I'm new to the area, I haven't had the opportunity to interview

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
with a wide variety of companies.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
I have looked at Bass Pro Shops and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
They have a similar mission and similar goals to REI.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
than REI's whatever sufferings.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
We here at REI, you know, it is being in customer service.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
There are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
than I could expect you being in a teaching position

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
face-to-face with individuals.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine as part of the job.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
But what I would expect is to be actively engaged with the customers

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
who come into the store and helping show them the products

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
that might best suit their needs and introducing them to products

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
that they might not have considered before.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
So what I would expect to be up moving around and being consistently engaged

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
with a customer or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and how did you deal with this?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And sometimes those initiatives get mandated.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
You have to teach this way this many times a week.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
to what you know about your profession or your skill set

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
And I think when faced with the difficulty again, it's important to do what the boss says.

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
And it's an important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
All right.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
We're going to move on to some cognitive behavioral questions.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And basically these questions are designed.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
They're not necessarily about your past, your experience.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
They're sort of out of the box questions.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
And so just do your best at answering them as soon as you go through this.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
So if you were an animal, what would you be and why?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
That's a tough question.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
I think considering the traits of my dog, if I had to be an animal,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
They just have that ability to love unconditionally.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
They're intensely loyal.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
And they just provide so many benefits to people.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And that's something I'd like to do in my life as a human too.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Great.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Tennis balls in a limousine.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, I guess to effectively answer that question, I would need some help.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Are we talking to door four door?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I also don't know what's in the limousine already.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Are there people in there or is it empty?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Once I had those questions answered, I would have to do some calculations

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
calculate the inside of the limousine, and then make sure the math works out.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I could get that answer to you.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I just can't do it off the top of my head.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Great.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Let me ask this final question.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Do you have any questions for us?

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, I've mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm just curious as a new employee or someone starting out on the lower level,

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
So these aren't things that are necessarily scheduled regularly.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
They're very semi-annual, they're very informal.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
We do like to hear our employees' opinions about our products especially and about marketing.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
or the intake and distribution of customer service calls.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Should you be hired for the position and maybe ways that we could do better,

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Okay.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
And the last question for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for REI?

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
And even in my position in somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
they're very good to our employees.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical in nature.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
It's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself.
