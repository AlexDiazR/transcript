00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi, Chris Sauer. Hi, Kate Johnson. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Kate.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Chris, please, tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, I'm currently finishing my Masters of Education program at Lake Erie College

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
and working on transitioning from a northeastern Ohio inner

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
to being a member of the Jacksonville area community.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Why the move?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Well, my wife's job is moving down south and I'm coming along with her.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
She's very noble and admirable about you at the same time.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
How did you hear about the position open with our company here at REI?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, when I thought about the opportunity of changing locations

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
and moving from one physical location to another,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I thought about making a career move as well.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And I was starting with my main interests and passions.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
And I love being outside, I love doing outdoor activities,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and I love working with people.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
I thought if I could use my experience as a teacher, helping people,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
and my interest in the outdoors together,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
that would be a good place to start a new career.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
And when I was looking online, I found REI's website

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
and that there were positions available in the Jacksonville area,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
so I thought I would apply.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Great. Well, you say you have an interest in outdoor activities,

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
so this would be a great company for you to work at.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
That being said, what else do you know about our company?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, I know you've been around for a long time since the late 1930s,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
and what really caught my attention the most was the idea

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
that it was started by people who had a passion for the outdoors

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
and found a way to involve others in their experience.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
I liked the idea, too, that your company is consistently ranked

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
among the top 100 companies to work for by Fortune Magazine.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
And I thought growing with a company that has that level of success

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
would be a good place to be.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Great.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Why do you want this particular position here

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
within our customer service department?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Because I want to start in a position that allows me

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
to learn everything about the company from the very basic level

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
of interacting with the customers all the way up

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
throughout the sales process, the marketing process,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
and the production of goods and services.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
When I saw the opportunity for customer service,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I thought it aligned very well with the skill set that I have

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
and also with some skills that I could bring to the company

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
that might be unique.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Can you tell me a little bit more about these skills

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
that you would transfer from your previous line of work

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
to our department here?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Sure. In education, it's all about making the customer

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
or student feel comfortable and helping them grow.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I feel that within a company like REI,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
it's the same philosophy, getting a customer comfortable

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
with the product and helping them grow as they advance

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
in whatever sport they happen to be participating in.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Why do you think that our company should hire you specifically

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
amongst our pool of candidates that are interviewing

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
for this position?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Sure. I think one skill set that I have

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
involves my background in education.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Teachers are among the highest stressed professionals

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
in the workplace, and REI offers a number of products

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
that help alleviate stress by getting people outdoors.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And teachers also have a lot of downtime in the summers.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
My thinking is that once I learn the ropes

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and advance within the company, I'll be able to market

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
the services and products that REI offers,

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
specifically to the teaching profession.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I have to ask this question.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Given that you are making a career change here,

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
especially with finishing a master's degree in education,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
if a position becomes available in your current field

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
down here in the Jacksonville area,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
how do you approach being offered this job

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
versus being offered a position in your field?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And I'm asking that in the now and in the future.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Sure. That's a great question.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm not pursuing further educational opportunities

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
within that profession.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I feel like this customer service opportunity,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
the chance to work in a field that I enjoy as much as teaching,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
is a place that I could grow into long term.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
So what I get out of teaching is working with people

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
and helping people become a little bit better

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
than they were when I first met them.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
And that skill translates very well into REI's mission.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And so I don't anticipate leaving a successful career

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
for something I've already done.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
I feel like this is a natural confluence of my two interests.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Great.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Chris, what would you identify

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
as your greatest professional strengths?

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, I think patience is probably my greatest strength.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
That translates across the careers,

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
being able to listen to a student or customer's difficulty

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
and help them overcome that difficulty

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
with patience and compassion is my greatest strength.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Would you consider any weaknesses

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
that you have to be detrimental to the job?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I think there's a risk when it comes to compassion.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
I think people can misinterpret compassion as being easy

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
or willing to roll over when it's important to understand

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
that compassion is something that is earned and it's interactive.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And I feel like if I establish clear boundaries

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
with customers, clients, students,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
they understand that I am understanding.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I am patient. I am kind.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Yet I'm also going to hold the people I interact with

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
to a high standard.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
To date, what would you say is your greatest professional achievement?

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Personally, becoming a teacher, earning a master's degree,

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
those have all been wonderful experiences for me.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
But the greatest achievement would have to be

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
working with young people

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
and helping them get a little bit better

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
at communicating with the world around them.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Chris, can you tell me about a challenge

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
or a conflict that you've faced in the workplace

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
and how you would deal with it?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Sure.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Within the education profession, there are challenges every day.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
You're dealing with hundreds of different personalities

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
and interests and levels of enthusiasm.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
So being able to engage students with content

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
in an enriching way is part of overcoming a conflict or difficulty.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I think building professional relationships

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
is another way to deal with conflicts,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
understanding where people come from.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Prior to teaching, I was involved with a photography company

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
photographing events like weddings and bar mitzvahs

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
and very, very important events in people's lives.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And a lot of times conflicts would arise.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
So again, just like in teaching,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
overcoming those conflicts with patients

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
and listening to the client or customers' needs

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
is very important.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Now, you are interviewing for a position

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
that is not an entry-level position

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
and there is the possibility that those in our company

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
that were overlooked for this position may have some animosity

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
regarding the new hire for this position.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
So how do you approach this potential challenge

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
here at the workplace?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
The important thing is to listen to the people around me

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
and understand that I am a newcomer

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
and that they know more about the work environment

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
than I will coming in.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
I think because I have a friendly demeanor

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
and I'm not confrontational when meeting new people

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
that in time will have a chance to earn each other's mutual respect

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
and understand that we both want the same thing,

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
the company to grow and us to grow within the company.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Where do you see yourself in five years,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
specifically within our company?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Hopefully I'll be able to develop a market

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
that allows me to interact with people within the teaching profession

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
and grow our brand using that market as a target client base.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
That's great.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Are you interviewing currently with any other companies

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
and if so, what interests you about those particular companies as well?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Since I'm new to the area,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I haven't had the opportunity to interview with a wide variety of companies.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I have looked at Bass Pro Shops

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
and I'm currently scheduled to interview with them.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
They have a similar mission and similar goals to REI.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
It's just that their product line is more specifically tailored

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
than REI's more diverse offerings.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
We here at REI, you know, it is, being in customer service,

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
there are aspects of your job that are going to be a little less active

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
than I could expect you being in a teaching position

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
where I assume you're on your feet more one-on-one face-to-face with individuals.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Do you prefer a specific type of work environment?

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Do you thrive in a variety of work environments and what does this look like?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Well, I thrive in a variety of work environments.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I wouldn't expect to be sitting in a cubicle interacting with customers

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
unless I'm handling a phone call and that's fine, that's part of the job.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
But what I would expect is to be actively engaged with the customers who come into the store

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
and helping show them the products that might best suit their needs

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and introducing them to products that they might not have considered before.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
So what I would expect is to be up moving around

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and being consistently engaged with a customer

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
or trying to find ways to improve what we offer to our customers.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Can you describe a time for me ever that you may have disagreed

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
on a decision that was made for you and staff members at work

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and how did you deal with this?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Sure, within the field of education, there are new initiatives being rolled out all the time

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
and sometimes those initiatives get mandated.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
You have to teach this way this many times a week

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
and when something like that happens, I think it's important to go back to

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
what you know about your profession or your skill set

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
and be able to provide research that supports why you do what you do.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
And I think when faced with a difficulty, again, it's important to do what the boss says

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
and it's important to also advocate for what might be best for the customer or student.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
Alright, we're going to move on to some cognitive behavioral questions

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
and basically these questions are designed...

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
They're not necessarily about your past, your experience,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
they're sort of out of the box questions

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
and so just do your best at answering them as we go through this.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
So if you were an animal, what would you be and why?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
That's a tough question.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
I think considering the traits of my dog, if I had to be an animal

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I would certainly want to be a domesticated dog.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
They just have that ability to love unconditionally, they're intensely loyal

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
and they just provide so many benefits to people.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
That's something I like to do in my life as a human too.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Great.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
The next question, how many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Tennis balls in a limousine.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, I guess to effectively answer that question I would need some help.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
I would need to know what type of limousine because if we're talking about a stretch SUV

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
that's a much larger volume than a smaller limousine.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Are we talking two-door, four-door?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I also don't know what's in the limousine already.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Are there people in there or is it empty?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Once I had those questions answered I would have to do some calculations

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
about the size of a tennis ball, how much area or how much volume it takes up,

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
calculate the inside of the limousine and then make sure the math works out.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
I could get that answer to you, I just can't do it off the top of my head.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Great.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Let me ask this final question.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Do you have any questions for us?

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
Well, I mentioned a couple times about being interested in helping grow a market for REI.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
I'm just curious, as a new employee or someone starting out on a lower level,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
how open is upper management hearing the ideas of an employee?

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
We do try to have monthly meetings where we meet with a variety of employees at random.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
These aren't things that are necessarily scheduled regularly.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
They're very semi-annual, they're very informal.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
We do like to hear our employees' opinions about our products especially and about marketing.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
One thing that we don't necessarily do is the lower level positions that are dealing maybe with collections

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
or the intake and distribution of customer service calls.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
We don't necessarily talk to that group of employees very often,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
but I'd be very interested to hear your opinions on that, should you be hired for the position

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
and maybe ways that we could do better as well by reaching a larger group of our employees to benefit our company.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
And the last question for me, what from your perspective is the best part about working for REI?

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
I think the work atmosphere with our company is very welcoming and even in my position

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
in somewhat upper management, those that I work for that are above me, we're very good to our employees.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
And I think because of the treatment of our employees, we retain employment.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
It's very easy for us to get things done because people want to do their jobs.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
I have worked myself in positions where I've worked underneath people who are more tyrannical in nature

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
and it's very difficult to want to do more and go above and beyond what you need to do in those situations.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
So I believe that that's the number one benefit of working in our particular company is the atmosphere itself.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Great. Thank you so much for your time, Kate.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Thank you so much.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Take care.
